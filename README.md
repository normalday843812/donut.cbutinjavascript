# Donut.C but in Javascript

Yes, I know that this has already been done many times before in basically every language (especially javascript), but I thought it could be a good learning experience for me.

I basically just tried to learn as much as possible from [https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) and Wikipedia.

I first tried to make as much as possible myself, then began using the deobfuscated donut.c code for reference. After I finished making my code, I used [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) to clean up the file and make the code to actually animate the donut in console.

This was a fun project overall. It gave me a great introduction to some concepts I hadn't learned and javascript.
